6pm EST to midnight during the week, 10AM EST to midnight on weekends!.This is my dev server - expect weird shit and bugs

Overview: Backpacks that follow you in death and between wipes, Food waste and preservation (use fridges, get salt from water purifiers), Scaling max stats and blueprint wipe on death, Deploy anywhere, Traps trigger on NPC, Custom NPC AI, custom hostility code, soft safezones. Tidal forces made worse by ovens, furnaces, and refiners, and dampened by planting hemp and letting it become a tree. Climate change simulator. Rainworld simulator. Pain simulator.

- Backpacks plugin, can't be looted and follows between deaths and server wipes.
- Deploy anywhere! Middle-click while holding the deployable to try to spawn it. Middle-click with a hammer to rotate if the angle is odd.
- NPCs unleashed! Junkpile scientists, peacekeepers, and bandit guards will random-roam, leading to surprise encounters
- NPCs have custom states, including chase states
- Attacking animals no longer triggers hostile - only attacks that hit BasePlayers (you and the NPCs) count towards hostility.
- Traps trigger both on animals and NPCs without triggering hostility
- Since peacekeeps and bandit guards also roam, hostile players will meet new encounters
- Turrets will fire on unaligned NPCs if they're hostile - so villages will defend you from scientists
- Someone marked hostile will not trigger hostility when shot on, even a while after their cooldown
- Safezones have been removed and are purely sustained by sentries - bandit sentries shoot blue scientists that have hostility
- Low decay, putting locks on vehicles reduces decay further, so does being near a TC
- Building using middle-button is pretty wacky but will try to respect some basic placement rules. Since it's still a no-build zone, things like wiring don't work
- Raw food rots in containers unless it's a fridge, or there's salt (in which case, it uses up salt instead)
- When stored with salt, plants stay fresh, and meat turns to jerky. So carry salt to protect your food long enough to get it fridged or cooked, or cook in the field.
- Processed foods now an important luxury, as they don't rot.
- It works by stacks (a rotten apple spoils the bunch) so spreading out the food in your inventory also helps save some of it.
- When berries are cooked with salt (????), they create jam, which are basically pickles.
- All ovens increase the tidal factor of the ocean level, that comes and goes as the day goes by (lowest at noon).
- Planting hemp and letting it die from old age will instead spawn a tree. This modifies a second factor in tidal math, dampening and even canceling the effect of ovens, if kept up with.
- Trees will not regrow after being cut - so replanting is necessary to not end up with a resource bottleneck
- Co-op not enforced, but obviously encouraged especially between those living at villages, outpost, bandit town
- Normal construction still possible and even suggested outside nobuild zones


Next steps:
- Debug wiring issue because being able to rework wiring could make for fun little puzzles
- Rework faction code to fit new AI approach, reimplement faction and squad controls
- This should allow aligning with tunnel dwellers, underwater dwelles, scientists, bandits, bears, boars, wolves, deer, and chicken independently. Maybe shark?!
- Look into parenting things middle-mouse-deployed to their collision point to allow boat and train monstrosities.
- Implement AI fighting over monuments, self-squadding, chance of calling nearby squad when in cover state
- Special little bit of trolling where roaming NPCs will sometimes linger near doors owned by players of opposing factions if they come upon their base
