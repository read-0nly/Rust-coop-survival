# Repo for development of my modded Rust server

Roadmap:
- ~Remove downsides to eating human meat~ < Done but in a lazy way - it would be better to modify the prefab defaults
- ~add chance of cannibal status~ < Done
- ~Cannibalism lowers hunger.max by A LOT but boosts max health. You can have more health than normal - as long as you KEEP EATING~ < Done but hackish and lazy
- *Cannibalism should grant nightvision* < Refuses to work - Current focus
- Base hunger and thirst reduced, driving more focus on scavenging 
- On death, some sort of log function tugs max health towards hunger/max point. So if you die hungry, you respawn with lower max health. Drive more scavenging
- Reduce gather rates considerably, increase loot tables especially of basic things like tools.
- No bases means no gigantic storage rooms with 200000k coal - you have a bag and whatever chest you put down that survives the night. 
  - Inventory management and choosing to keep the tuna can or the knife becomes hopefully an important decision again
  - The entire point here is to remove abundance. Scarcity motivates acquisition, motivates interaction and engagement with environment.
  - Abundance motivates shuffling chests for an hour.
  - The comfort of a safe hovel is fleeting.
  - Logging off becomes a quest for the best hiding spots
- 5 different towns with their own themes, scattered points of interest between
- No build restrictions in structures - building entirely new map with custom monuments to serve the purpose
- No decay protection - so you need to maintain what you wanna keep manually.
- Decay fiddling so that most things last 24 hours unattended
- Hidden shops scattered with their own inventories and prices. No map pins
- More car availability
- Remove crafting of high-tier things like AKs, most ammo crafting, or change costs to make it unviable. 
  - Guns should be there as a wildcard but should be hard to acquire. No one should be armed to the teeth. 
    - Ideally, they mostly get used in desperation facing off cannibals (or by those cannibals desperate for a meal)
- Permanent fog
- Custom plant breeding code, Custom animal breeding code, based off population in range on some event. 
  - Animals that have eaten drop a seed of something they ate that night
  - When an animal eats, if there are 1-3 others nearby, they breed
  - Animals have their own hunger system
    - Deer like corn and berries and hemp
    - Bears like corn and berries and pumpkin
    - Pigs like mushroom, corn, and pumpkin
- No chat, voicechat only
- Phones, CCTVs, some leftover computers for communication/surveillance
