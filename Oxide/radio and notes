Remove crafting of high-tech things
Small chance of hightech in blue barrels
Vehicles won't die for 36 hours after driving
Each village has a smattering of each shop type - more vehicle/component stuff in garage, more deployables in factory town, more foodstuffs in fish/river towns more weapons in northern town, basic resources at factories. Some places have better prices than others too. Other shops sprinkled through the detritus
No shop map markers
Add peacekeeper scientists, more random scientists
Middle has high-tech stuff but also roaming scientists
Add APC routes?
remove axe/pickaxe crafting?
remove crafting entirely? Or bring up research costs considerably
Ecosystem AI patch? Start with a few animal spawners, each animal type has a min and max population, on tick, check if local population in range - if so, random chance to breed. With it, give animals hunger - bear, deer, boar eat plants. Bears like berries, pigs prefer corn/pumpkin/mushroom, deer eat hemp/berries/corn. wolves will hunt deer and boar and chickens. If they don't eat in time, they die. Bears and Wolves will target scientists
Plant breeding system?
